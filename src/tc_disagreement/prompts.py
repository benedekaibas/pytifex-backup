that causes DISAGREEMENTS between type checkers (mypy, pyrefly, zuban, ty).

Below are REAL code examples extracted from closed GitHub issues in type checker repositories.
These represent actual bugs - false positives (checker reports error when code is correct) or
false negatives (checker misses a real error).

## REAL BUG EXAMPLES FROM TYPE CHECKER ISSUES:

{seeds_text}

## YOUR TASK:

Using these real bugs as inspiration, generate {num_variations} NEW Python code examples that:

1. Are VARIATIONS or EXTENSIONS of the patterns shown above
2. Target subtle type system edge cases likely to cause checker disagreements
3. Are self-contained and runnable (include all imports)
4. Have a minimal `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

## KNOWN DIVERGENCE PATTERNS TO TARGET:

{patterns_text}

## STRATEGY FOR GENERATING DIVERGENCES:

- If a seed shows a false positive in mypy, try to create a similar case that other checkers also get wrong
- If a seed shows a false negative, create variations that test the boundaries of what gets caught
- Combine patterns: e.g., TypedDict + Protocol, ParamSpec + classmethod
- Modify the seeds slightly: change types, add generics, wrap in decorators

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each example, use this exact format:

# id: <short-kebab-name>
# category: <pattern category>
# seed_issue: <repo>#<issue_number> (REQUIRED - must reference a real seed issue from above)

```python
<your code here>
```

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Generate exactly {num_variations} examples
- EVERY example MUST have a valid seed_issue referencing one of the GitHub issues shown above
- Do NOT use "original" - all examples must be inspired by a real issue
- Focus on NOVEL variations, not copies of the seeds
- Distribute examples across different seed issues (not all from the same one)

1. Each snippet must be SELF-CONTAINED and RUNNABLE
2. Use ONLY valid Python 3.12+ syntax and REAL typing features
3. NO forward reference issues - use string annotations if needed: `-> "ClassName"`
4. Each snippet must target a SPECIFIC type checker divergence area
5. Include imports from `typing` and `typing_extensions` as needed
6. Include a minimal `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

STRATEGIES:
1. If all passed: Add a subtle type error that only some checkers catch
2. If all failed: Fix the obvious error but keep a subtle edge case
3. Change the typing pattern slightly (add Protocol, use TypeGuard, add overloads)
4. Wrap in a decorator with ParamSpec
5. Use TypedDict with Required/NotRequired inheritance

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep it self-contained and runnable
- Use valid Python 3.12+ syntax
- Target a real type system ambiguity, not just syntax tricks

## OUTPUT:
